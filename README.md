# Health-Care-Cryptosystem
The Healthcare industry is extremely thriving and the database used and generated by it very vast and critically categoried.
Using classes and interfaces provided by the 'java.security' and 'javax.crypto' packages.
Implementing a secure healthcare cryptosystem that encrypts sensitive patient data using RSA encryption before uploading it to the cloud.
For every check up RSA cryptosystem is used for securing the data.
Only admins view the patient file without encrpytion .They know the key for encryption.
Establish proper key management practices to securely store and handle encryption keys.
Differentiate between read-only access for healthcare providers and full access for administrators.
Ensure that communication channels between the healthcare system and the cloud service provider are secure.
Provide training and education to users of the healthcare system to raise awareness about security best practices and the importance of safeguarding patient data.
